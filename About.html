            <p>Health care industry has huge amount of data that contains hidden information.This information supports decision making process on related area. In this research paper,we discussed various approaches of data mining which are useful in predicting the disease. One of the complex tasks in healthcare industry is predicting the disease and it requires more experience and knowledge. Some of the ways of predicting disease are ECG,stress test and disease MRI etc. Here the system uses 14 parameters for predicting diseases that include blood pressure,cholesterol,chest pain and disease rate. These parameters are used to improve an accuracy level. The main aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of data mining techniques on diagnosing disease.Healthcare industry has huge amount of data that contains hidden information.
